            <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating
                third-party libraries.
                <p/>
                <p>JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.</p>
                <code>
x = true;
if (x) then console.log("It is true");

            <p> JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also enables users to load content
                into a document without reloading the entire page
                <p/>
                <p>Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other if they come
                    from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).</p>
                <code>
x = true;
if (x) then console.log("It is true");
</code>

            <p>Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript
                code are all in text. They require different plug-ins.
                <p/>
                <p>JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers)
                    from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation. </p>

x = true;
if (x) then console.log("It is true");

            <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help. But as it evolved, JavaScript became
                a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.

                Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles. React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses. Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
                Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages. Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).

            <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it. JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s
                running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc. In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user,
                and the webserver.</p>
